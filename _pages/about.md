I'm a research scientist at Intel working on privacy-enhancing technologies. So far, my primary focus has been on homomorphic encryption.

Most recently I've ben working on [Intel HEXL](https://github.com/intel/hexl), an open-source C++ library accelerating homomorphic encryption using AVX512. I've also worked on the [Intel Homomorphic Encryption Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/homomorphic-encryption.html?wapkw=homomorphic%20encryption).

Prior to that, I worked on [nGraph-HE](https://github.com/IntelAI/he-transformer), an open-source framework for deep learning inference on homomorphically encrypted data.

I received my M.S. in Computational and Mathematical Engineering from Stanford University. I received my B.S. in Computer Science and B.S. in Applied and Computational Mathematics from Caltech.

# Interests
I enjoy tackling problems at the intersection of mathematics and software engineering. I am currently working on homomorphic encryption and other privacy-preserving machine learning technologies.

I also enjoy learning the nitty gritty details of C++ (I recommend reading Scott Myers' *Effective Modern C++*) and optimizing software development workflow using modern tools such as [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), and [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html).

My personal interests include running, cycling, soccer, and playing clarinet.
